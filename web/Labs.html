            Lab 1: HTML/CSS
            <br/>
            <p> I had never worked with HTML/CSS prior to this class. This class, so far, has taught
                some pretty interesting stuff, and I hope to continue to learn more. Getting familiar 
                with HTML/CSS has been quite fun. The fact that you can play around with stuff really
                intrigues me.

            Lab 2: Javascript
            <br/>
            <p>
                Learning Javascript has been an quite an experience. I like the fact that
                a variable can be assigned as a string or any other data type. I think its 
                pretty neat. I quite enjoyed the animation assignment. Learning how the sprite interacts
                with the rest of the page was interesting.

            Lab 3: jQuery
            <br/>
            <p>
                This lab was slightly harder to finish. Getting the animations to work properly took a 
                lot more time and effort then expected. Seeing, the final result was quite satisfying. There are some
                changes to the titlenav. It now has an image on the left, which links back to the main web page. The
                nav slides down when hovered over. There is a box which when hovered over reveals a hidden image. The
                website fade in slowly whenever it's refreshed or visited. The footer also has a small animation 
                when ever it's interacted with. This page is now the new index.html page.

            Lab 4: Responsive Design
            <br/>
            <p>
                This lab was fairly easier than the other labs. I have used the basic bootstrap layout. The nav
                has certain changes from the default layout that was there on the bootstrap website. For example, 
                The nav bar has a fixed position, and is transparent. There are several media queries each for a 
                different screen widths. I had difficulty, with getting the nav bar to work properly when the screen
                was in mobile mode. Specifically, the nav bar's drop down menu would not work when clicked in the 
                mobile mode. The problem was solved by changing the some of the settings in the navbar's wrapper. 
                I have also used bootstraps carousel class and used three images that change at an interval. I also
                use bootstraps row and col classes, as per the requirement of the lab. There are three links in the 
                nav. Two link to various sections of the page, while one links back to the top of the page. The title
                of the website also, links back to the top of the page.

                Looking at the expo link on the bootstrap website. I really like the website blackbox.cool. The 
                animation on the page is really extravagant. I like the whole card like layout that the website has.
                The website has the typical bootstrap response which changes the animation size when going into 
                mobile mode. <a href="http://cis-linux2.temple.edu:8080/fa16_4350_tuf37373/Bootstrap_Lab.html">Link to Lab4</a>

            <h3> Lab 5</h3>
            <p>
               Not know anything about databases, this lab was kind of tricky to finish. Now, that I've completed it,
               I finally understand how things work. It's not as difficult as I was expecting it to be. The hardest part
               was probably getting the foreign key to work right.

            <p>
               This lab was quite interesting. Learning how to use a database and implementing a web page using the data
               was a nice experience. Getting the javascript page was a lot easier than the jQuery page. I had some 
               difficulty with getting images to display into one of the columns, but I was able to fix that.

                This lab was fairly easy to do. Reading the code examples helped out a lot.

            <h3>Tutorial</h3>
            <p>
                The tutorial I did was on LESS, which is a CSS pre-processor. I think that it is a very useful tool
                that every web developer should use. It makes writing of CSS much easier.
