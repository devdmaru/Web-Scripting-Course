                    <h4>Gamplay</h4>
                    <p>
                        Fallout 4's gameplay is similar to that of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, 
                        the previous two main entries in the series. Returning features include a 
                        camera that can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective, 
                        and the ability to roam anywhere on the map. Fallout 4 introduces new features 
                        including a layered armor system, base-building, a dynamic dialogue system 
                        featuring 111,000 lines of dialogue, an in-depth crafting system which 
                        implements every lootable object in the game, and much more. Enemies such 
                        as mole rats, raiders, super-mutants, deathclaws, and feral ghouls return in 
                        Fallout 4, along with the companion Dogmeat.Players have the ability to 
                        roam anywhere on the map, and leave a conversation at any time. They have 
                        the ability to customize weapons; the game includes over 50 base guns, which 
                        can be crafted with a variety of modifications, such as barrel types and 
                        laser focus, with over 700 modifications available.
